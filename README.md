# Documentation
When this is  officially released, links to the documentation will be here. I will also add tutorials on how to use 
seperate parts of SkJade to the wiki at some point, however when that point will be is a good question.

## Forking
If you ever find yourself wanting to fork this for whatever reason, most likely to correct something wrong I've done, 
it's a giant pain in the ass, so I advise against it, however if you do, you should probably see this. You will need to 
have run BuildTools on the computer which the project will be on. Get BuildTools 
[here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/), and follow provided tutorial to get the following
versions:  
 ⭐ 1.16.5  
 ⭐ 1.15.2  
 ⭐ 1.14.4  
 ⭐ 1.13.2  
These are used in the modules and maven likes to throw errors.  
  
You should also go into the maven tab (on the right of intellij) and open all the module folders. Go into lifestyle, 
and run Clean, then Install on every one. Do the `SkJade` one last, as this is what requires these modules. To build 
the jar, run package in the `SkJade` module. It should work c: If it doesn't then i have no clue soz<3
